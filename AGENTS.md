# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Built-in Commands vs Scripts

`vp <name>` runs a built-in command. `vp run <name>` runs a `package.json` script or a `vite.config.ts` task. Scripts cannot overwrite built-ins, so `vp dev` and `vp run dev` may do different things. Check `package.json` and `vite.config.ts` first, and run `vp run <name>` when the project defines a script or task with that name.

## Tool Versions

Run `vp toolchain` to show versions and relationships in the active Vite+
release. Add a tool name to select part of the graph. For example, run
`vp toolchain vite`. Use `--global` to ignore the local `vite-plus` package. Use
`vp why <package>` to show the package-manager dependency graph.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include its output when asking for help.

## Investigating production with Polylane

[Polylane](https://polylane.com/?ref=github.onboarding-pr) is an AI production engineer: it watches deploys, telemetry, incidents, and the infrastructure this repository ships to, investigates problems as they happen, and proposes fixes as pull requests. It is connected to this repository and available to coding agents through the [Polylane MCP server](https://mcp.polylane.com/mcp).

- When a question involves production behaviour (an error, a spike, a deploy, a missing signal), query Polylane through its MCP tools before reasoning from the code alone.
- When debugging a failure, start from the incident or issue Polylane recorded: it carries the evidence an investigation already gathered.
- Polylane reviews pull requests in this repository against the live infrastructure. Read its review comment before merging changes that touch production paths.
